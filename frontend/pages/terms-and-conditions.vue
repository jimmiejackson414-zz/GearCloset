            Fraud Management Policies
          </p>
          <p class="body-text-1">
            Gear Closet uses fraud detection software that automatically flags suspect transactions. Every transaction is assigned a fraud potential score based on the following criteria:
          </p>
          <ul class="mb-2">
            <li>An AVS match of the cardholder's billing address and zip code;</li>
            <li>A CSC/CVC match against the credit card;</li>
            <li>A transaction history of the user that flags multiple declined credit card transaction attempts with incorrect credit card numbers;</li>
            <li>High quantity line item orders;</li>
            <li>Order history and frequency;</li>
            <li>Mismatched billing and shipping addresses;</li>
            <li>International orders;</li>
            <li>Open or closed proxy server access to our Website;</li>
            <li>Client IP location resolution vs. the cardholder billing city and zip;</li>
            <li>Known countries with high incidence of fraud (e.g., Indonesia, Nigeria, Eastern Europe), as well as known postal codes within all countries from which a high incidence of fraud is known to originate (based on U.S. fraud tracking databases).</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="body-text-1">
            If one of the above criteria do not match (especially the AVS/CSC/CVC), and/or the fraud score indicates a high potential for fraud, we may contact you <u>by telephone</u> (this is why a valid telephone number is required for all orders) for the purpose of:
          </p>
          <ol class="mb-2">
            <li>Confirm your cardholder billing information and CSC/CVC codes, or to ask you other questions about your order;</li>
            <li>Ask for the name and telephone number of the issuing bank of your credit card so we can call them and confirm the authenticity of the transaction.</li>
          </ol>
          <p class="body-text-1">
            <b>What do we do when we suspect a fraudulent transaction?</b> If we fail to contact you because you left an invalid phone number, or we were unable to confirm transaction authenticity with the issuing bank, your order will not be dispatched and your order will be canceled.
          </p>
          <p class="body-text-1">
            If we receive a "Notice of Fraudulent Transaction" or a "Chargeback Request" (related to a suspected fraudulent transaction) from our transaction processor, we work with the transaction processor to ensure that the true cardholder is reimbursed within 24 hours by reversing their transaction. Second, we automatically file a "Report of Suspected Credit Card Fraud" with the local law enforcement intelligence jurisdictions (including local and state authorities) for the following localities: cardholder billing address (if known), shipping address of order, and claimed billing address of order. In addition, we file these reports with our transaction processor (Merchant Service Bank) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Internet Fraud Division. For transactions originating from both open and closed proxies with international Client IP Addresses, or international shipping addresses, we submit the reports to the appropriate government law enforcement authorities.
          </p>
          <p class="body-text-1">
            We block user accounts and IP addresses (whether open or closed proxy) in cases where confirmed fraudulent transactions are originating from those accounts or IP addresses or IP address ranges. These are not subject to appeal. If you have an Internet Service Provider that is known for hosting fraudulent transactions at GearCloset.com, then weâ€™ll block it from accessing the GearCloset.com Website. In this case, the customerâ€™s only solution is to change Internet Service Providers.
